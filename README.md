# Kernel
a basic kernel

Included bash scripts to build and run using qemu which you can add to a linux machine with sudo apt-get install qemu x86
Also place your kernel in /Documents to get a proper build or modify the build scrip to your needs!
Very simple Kernel that is bootable.

Current completed commands are print(insert text here), exit and clear.

The code is currently split into a couple files with helper functions and keyboard tables.

The project is on going hoping to continue to add functionallity as time goes on.
