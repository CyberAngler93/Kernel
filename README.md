# Kernel
a basic kernel

Included bash scripts to build and run using qemu which you can add to a linux machine with sudo apt-get install qemu
Very simple Kernel that is bootable.

We have a working keyboard input with backspace. We hope to move foreword and split some functions into seperate files to have cleaner code. Add more keycodes into our input section. Possible make a basic shell that can take some commands. As well as fix a real timer . Also a sort of menu that is navigateable by arrow keys and enter. with text highlighting.
